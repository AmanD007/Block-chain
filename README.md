Description:-Secure Banking using Blockchain
Key Features of Blockchain in Banking
1)Decentralization:
  Eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing transaction costs and time.
2)Transparency:
  All transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger, visible to authorized participants.
3)Immutability:
  Transactions once recorded cannot be altered, reducing fraud risks.
4)Enhanced Security:
  Uses cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions.
5)Smart Contracts:
  Automates transactions when predefined conditions are met, reducing human errors and delays.
How It Works:-
The HTML form collects transaction details (sender, receiver, amount).
The Servlet processes the data and stores it in the database.
The Blockchain class can be extended to read transactions from the database and create blocks.
This setup provides a basic blockchain implementation. To make it production-ready, you should:

Implement proper error handling.
Add cryptographic signing for transactions.
Use APIs to expose blockchain functionalities.
